# Ante Up! To Do List

The following is a list of things that need to be finished before an alpha release can be ready:

* `admin_cash.php` needs to utilize the new currency and date code. In all honesty, it should be completely rewritten.
* The menu item needs to pull the data from the database. This has been started, but not finished.
* Langauge files need to be rewritten. There is a lot of hardcoded text strings in the plugin that has been added (by me) or changed.

If you wish to help out with any of this [fork the repo](https://github.com/septor/anteup/fork), make the changes, and then send a [pull request](https://github.com/septor/anteup/pull/new/master).
