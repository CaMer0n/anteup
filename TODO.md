#TODO
What's left to complete before 1.0.0-beta. These include all of the issues in the issue tracker under the 1.0.0-beta milestone:

* Rewrite `donations.php`. It currently doesn't even load.
	* It also needs to be moved to the template system if possible.
* Rewrite the LANs in all areas. Some of this has already begun.
	* Basically all of the current LAN calls are now invalid with all of the rewrites.
* The README file needs to have all alpha comments and "DO NOT"s stripped from it.

## Post 1.0.0-beta

Yeah, this is in the future, but I feel like it's fine to put the following here:

* Add in export to Excel (.xls) functionality (#7).
* Look into PM implementation (#19).
* Tap into e_notify (or whatever it is, if that's deprecated) for email notification.
* Obviously fix any issues from the beta.
